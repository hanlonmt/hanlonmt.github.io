# Overall goals

My research focus is plant root growth and behavior, with the goal of understanding how plant roots respond to abiotic stresses and respond to obtain limiting resources. Plant roots serve not only to anchor plants in the soil, but also to obtain nearly all of the water and nutrients that plants need to grow. I've worked with numerous species, including tomato, maize, rice, and, like all *good* plant biologists, Arabidopsis. I'm attempting to take some of the knowledge that we have about Arabidopsis and apply it to other, less well-understood growth systems, notably those in the most important global cereal grains (rice and maize). Like many plant biologists, I have the goal to help feed, fuel, and clothe the worth with maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact. 

# Current projects

## Lateral Root Plagiogravitropism

I've always been fascintated by lateral roots, notably their ability to resist the pull of gravity and grown at an angle that is neither completely with or against the gravity vector. I'm working to figure out *how* these roots, which make up the majority of root systems, do this. Root angle is an important trait for nutrient acquisition, namely shallow angles are better for phosphorus acquisition and deeper angles for water and nitrogen acquisition. 

I'm doing this work in *Arabidopsis* and have had the pleasure of working with Dr. Malcolm Bennett and his research group at the Centre for Integrative Plant Biology at the University of Nottingham and with Dr. Karin Ljung and her group at the Ume&aring; Plant Science Centre in Ume&aring;, Sweden.

More information on this project will be forthcoming as publications are prepared.

## Buffered Phosphorus Delivery

Phosphorus is limiting to plant growth worldwide, and the pressures on farmers to produce more food with less input will only increase in the future. Understanding how plants responsd to and deal with stress is integral to improving our crop efficiency. Unfortunately, the majority of our knowledge on this matter comes from Arabidopsis grown in an artificial, gel-based media. Though this system is great for imaging and studies, it poorly mimics soil chemistry and actual plant phosphorus exposure.

To combat this, we've developed a system where phosphorus is bound to alumina particles. In this system, the plants are forced to come into contact with the particles and release the phosphorus, much as they must do in soil. We've observed drastically different responses, both on a phenotypic and gene expression level, by using this system.

## GWAS: finding candidate genes

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) harness the power of natural variation to identify genes that control complex traits that are important to plant growth and success. In collaboration with a former lab-mate, Phanchita Vejchasarn, and the lab of Dr. Susan McCouch at Cornell University, we have phenotyped a wide variety of rice lines for root traits and performed GWAS on each of these.

I have now been tasked with discovering genes that underlie the 'hits' that we've discovered in the GWAS. This work is computationally intensive, something I, a biologist, never thought I would be doing. I've learned quite a few skills and am working on pushing these findings to publication.

# Previous Work

## Manganese Toxicity 

When I first started in the Roots lab, we were working on uncovering connections between manganese toxicity, light intensity, and the photo-oxidative stress system. Through this work, I increased my plant nutrition knowledge concerning mangenese, which is a detrimental stress to many plants, including maple trees in Pennsylvania forests.

## Cellulose synthesis

As a technician with the Center for Lignocellulose Structure and Formation, I worked to discover binding partners of the cellulose synthase complex in *Acetobacter xylinus*, a cellulose-forming bacteria. Through this work, I mastered skills in molecular and microbiology prior to starting graduate school.

## Auxin and plant-microbe interactions

I got my feet wet in science under the tutelege of Dr. Catharina Coenen at Allegheny College in Meadville, PA, as an undergraduate. There, I worked to uncover a role for auxin in the formation of symbiosis between mycorrhizal fungi and tomato roots. We published the majority of our findings in 2011, and since then, others have found that auxin is important for many plant-microbe interactions. At the end of this project, I said that I would never work on two things: auxin and phosphorus. If you've read this whole page, you know that I have an inability to predict the future.
