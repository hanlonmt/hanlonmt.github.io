This is a collection of things I like and want you to know about. I'm likely forgetting things and will be updating this as I discover new favorites! This should be somewhat organized and navigable from the contents menu on the right. I am an Android and Windows (holler, ThinkPad) user, so anything that is Apple-specific probably won't show up here.

# Apps
I use many stock apps (Gmail/Inbox is growing on me, Maps, Calendar) and other standard apps (I'm looking at you, Facebook), but I'll use this space to highlight things that don't just come with your phone.
<br><br>

## Listening
- **[PocketCasts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts):** I used to use [Sticher](https://www.stitcher.com/). I paid some money and switched to Pocket Casts. It's been a dream. Listening sync across devices (phone, tablet, computer), feeds are auto-updated, and the search feature works (something I strugged with for a long time on Sticher). It's great. If you're not totally in love with your podcast app, use this. I also used to use [DoggCatcher](http://www.doggcatcher.com/), but have gotten everything I've wanted in PocketCasts, so I've completely moved all of my listening there. My only gripe is that it doesn't fully integrate with my [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com/?r=1) for at home listening. I'm intrigued by the fact that [Google might be putting together a podcast service](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/google-play-music-podcasts-are-live-for-some-users/), but it's going to take a lot to get me away from Pocketcasts.
- **[Google Music All Acccess](https://play.google.com/about/music/allaccess/#/):** I used Spotify and Pandora, but found the Spotify app to be buggy and was sick of hearing about the Free Business Cards I had won on Pandora. I switched to Google's platform and haven't looked back, as it has a huge library and has helped me discover some new music. I still go back to Pandora sometimes, but that is happening less and less. There are some things I miss about Spotify, but I've gotten Google Music working to my liking
- **[Sonos](http://www.sonos.com/?r=1):** Not so much an app as it is a product (you need the speaker for the app to work), but it's the only way I listen to music, news, or podcasts when I'm at home.
- **[OverDrive](http://www.overdrive.com/):** Coupled with my local library resources, I use this to listen to audiobooks when there's something I really want to *read* and don't have time to get my hands on the book. I've read quite a few books this way while working in the lab.

## News and Reading
- **[NPR News](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.npr.android.news)**
- **[NY Times](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nytimes.android)**
- **[Digg](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diggreader):** I shed some tears when Google Reader died, but I like what I've put together at Digg, and it works great.
- **[Instapaper](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instapaper.android):** Some people prefer Pocket, but Instapaper is my go-to for offline reading.

##Exercise
- **[GarminConnect](https://connect.garmin.com/en-US/):** I splurged and bought myself a Garmin [ForeRunner620](https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/into-sports/running/forerunner-620/prod122785.html) and some [magnet-less sensors](http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2014/05/garmins-spd-cad-magnetless-sensors.html) for my bike. Pairing these up with an ANT+ sensor and Zwift made my indoor trainer rides a million times more enjoyable this past winter. It also automatically syncs with Strava.
- **[Strava](https://www.strava.com):** I danced around between RunKeeper, Map My Run, and Endomondo, but finally gave into using Strava due to the Garmin integration. Though I haven't been running much, I'm looking forward to tracking my summer bike rides on there (and getting some local QOM crowns!).
- **[Zwift](http://zwift.com/):** The only way I've been able to actually enjoy my indoor trainer rides. The winters are cold and dark in PA, so I spend a good bit of time riding inside. This makes it not just bearable, but fun.
- **[Nike Training Club](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nike.ntc):** I reach to NTC when I need some new workout ideas or just lack the motivation to put together a workout for myself. Lots of interesting content, though I often don't have the space or equipment required. I also wish it worked better with just audio instruction. I like this, I don't *love* it.
- **[Pocket Yoga](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rainfrog.yoga):** I'm not a huge yoga person, but I occasionally reach toward this if I feel like I need to do something to help me gain some mobility or just relax before bed. This is the best app I've come across to help start a habit.

##Other
- **[Accuweather](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accuweather.paid.android):** I have to root for the hometown team when it comes to weather forecasts. I've used other apps in the past, but Accuweather has served me well.
- **[Evernote](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evernote):** I either use this or [Google Keep](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep) to quickly write things down, but I'm not a dedicated device note-taker. I usually use pen and paper, or I just remember things. If my memory starts to fail, maybe I'll become more of a devotee, but my system works fine for now.
- **[TripIt](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripit):** I got a free trial of the pro version with my credit card. I've since become dependent on it anytime I travel. If you don't have some sort of travel managing app, look into this.
- **[Duolingo](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo):** I'm always trying, but failing, to learn other languages. It's no fault of Duolingo, though.


# Podcasts
I love podcasts, and am constantly increasing my library. I tend to triage my listening into shows I can't miss, those I try to catch, and those that I keep around to listen to when I have lots of time. I generally listen while doing lab work, while at the gym, or while on any sort of public transit. Believe it or not, this list is incomplete, though I have most of my favorites here.

##Classics
- **[Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/):** I think my podcast obsession started with Radiolab back before smartphones were ubiquitous. I had all of the episodes of Radiolab on my iPod and would listen to them repeatedly. Jad and Robert were the soundtrack to many of my experiments.  All of the episodes are good, but one of my personal favorites is [Lost & Found](http://www.radiolab.org/story/110079-lost-found/).
- **[This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/):** I used to plan to run errand or do something of the sort so that I could be in my car during the airing of TAL on my local NPR station. Now, I don't have to do that, but I do try to catch it on the radio whenever I can. A favorite is tough, because the themes range from serious and tear-jerking to incredibly hilarious. I'm partial to Sarah Koenig's stories, including [Dr. Gilmer & Mr. Hyde](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/492/dr-gilmer-and-mr-hyde), the episode about Penn State [#1 Party School](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/396/1-party-school), and [The Seven Things You're Not Supposed to Talk About](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/511/the-seven-things-youre-not-supposed-to-talk-about). I also like [The Problem We All Live With](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) which discusses the extreme inequity in the American education system.
- **[Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/):** If you don't know what this is, then you must be new to the Internet. Though the second season is quite different from the first, I still catch every episode.
- **[The Moth](http://themoth.org/):** Storytelling. It's funny, it's emotional, it's everything you want a story to be. The hour-long episodes are my favorite to pass time with in the lab. This episode, [I need to talk about Anne Frank](http://themoth.org/posts/stories/i-need-to-talk-about-anne-frank), comes to mind as a favorite of mine.
- **[The Story Collider](http://storycollider.org/):** Stories about science, what more could you want! Some are heavier on science, some on laughs. I recently listened to [Who's the Donor?](http://storycollider.org/podcast/2014-10-09).
- **[Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/):** I often miss the news, and catch up on it here. It's entertaining and often the news stories aren't important. Perfect.
- **[Fresh Air](http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/):** Am I the only one who dreams of Terry Gross asking me questions? I also get a little bit sad when David Bianculli is sitting in for TG. There are also so many cataloged episodes of Fresh Air that there's never a shortage of interviews to listen to.

##Money
- **[Freakonomics](http://freakonomics.com/radio/):** I usually learn something new, though I don't love every episode. I do like this [episode about education](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/is-americas-education-problem-really-just-a-teacher-problem/).
- **[APM: Marketplace](http://www.marketplace.org/marketplace-podcasts):** I don't pretend to understand economics, but I like to have some idea of what's happening with markets and money.
- **[Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/):** You're like 'economics, this is going to be boring', except it isn't. Check out this episode on [The Tale of the Onion King](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/10/14/448718171/episode-657-the-tale-of-the-onion-king).


##Food
- **[The Dinner Party Download](http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/):** Food and pop-culture come together. I like to pick up on new music, and get some great etiquette advice.
- **[The Sporkful](http://www.sporkful.com/):** "It's not for foodies, it's for eaters" is the tagline for this podcast. Food is awesome. Listen.
- **[Spilled Milk](http://www.spilledmilkpodcast.com/):** I started listening to this podcast after the green beans episode, because I have personal history with green beans (story coming, sometime). It's about food, and is even more casual than the Sporkful (another favorite of mine) and makes me hungry if I listen before lunch.
- **[Gastropod](http://gastropod.com/):** This one is new to me, but I like it so far. It might advance in the rankings once I get through a few more episodes.
- **[Burnt Toast from Food52](http://food52.com/topics/burnt-toast-podcast):** I go to Food52 for recipes, why not for listening?
- **[Special Sauce with Ed Levine](http://seriouseats.libsyn.com/podcast):** Serious Eats is my go-to for recipes and general kitchen advice. Though my scientific standpoint is usually quite different from Michael Pollan's, I really liked [this episode with him](http://seriouseats.libsyn.com/podcast/special-sauce-michael-pollan-on-cracker-jack-and-childhood-gardens).

##Other things that I haven't put in specific categories:
- **[Start-Up](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/):** A show about a start-up company that will make podcasts. It's meta, but the stories are good as is the insight. Season one was about Gimlet, the company that now makes quite a few podcasts. Start there and learn.
- **[Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/):** How could I not love a show about the internet? It's the first show made by Gimlet Media (that isn't Start-Up). They discuss all sorts of things, including [online dating](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/27-the-fever/) and [weird internet office culture](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/29-the-takeover/).
- **[Call Your Girlfried](http://callyourgirlfriend.com/):** Living abroad, or just far away from your best friends, makes you miss the kind of conversations that the hosts of this show have with each other. Listen to all of them. Catch the live shows. They're all my favorites.
- **[Death, Sex, and Money](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/deathsexmoney/):** Discussions about things that we don't talk about (but should).
- **[Slate: Double X Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/doublex_gabfest.html):** Sometimes good, sometimes not.
- **[Pop Culture Happy Hour](http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/129472378/pop-culture-happy-hour/):** Their episode on [House Hunters International](http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2014/10/07/354286887/pop-culture-happy-hour-small-batch-house-hunters-international) hit close to home because I love(d) House Hunters.
- **[Another Round](http://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround):** If you haven't heard Heben and Tracy interview [Hillary Clinton](http://www.buzzfeed.com/adamdavis/listen-to-hillary-clintons-interview-with-buzzfeed#.ku1a841Ywz), then I don't know where you've been. They also appreciate the deals you can get at Ross Dress for Less, so what isn't there to love?
- **[Can I Pet Your Dog?](http://cipyd.libsyn.com/podcast):** I love dogs. This makes me smile. I can't make it through the theme song without having a goofy grin on my face.
- **[Hidden Brain](http://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain):** It's all about us, and what drives us. Check out this episode with [Aziz Ansari](http://www.npr.org/2015/11/17/455674528/aziz-ansari-talking-modern-love-with-the-master-of-none), but browse the catalog, because something will probably pique your interest.
- **[Hot Takedown from FiveThirtyEight](http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/index):** Sports. Numbers. I'm in.
- **[Invisibilia](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/):** All great, but don't miss [this one](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/384065938/the-power-of-categories?showDate=2015-02-06) on the power of categories.
- **[Limetown](http://www.limetownstories.com/):** Fictional, but a good story to listen to! Start at the beginning.
- **[Longform](http://longform.org/):** If you like the interviewee, check it out. They've talked to an impressive number of people.
- **[Nerdette](https://www.wbez.org/shows/nerdette/b2c2c10b-1e7f-43ca-b3ad-55d6fd33722c):** Women and nerdy things. Check out anything, including [this episode with Amy Stewart about Boozy Botany](https://www.wbez.org/shows/nerdette/boozy-botany-and-the-story-of-marian-anderson/bba23a17-6618-4b82-b4a1-accc39e35cc5).
- **[Note to Self](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself/):** But only if you want to be freaked out by technology.
- **[On the Media](http://www.wnyc.org/series/media-podcast):** All of it.
- **[Only Human](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/onlyhuman/):** Science(lite) and fun.
- **[Pilot](https://soundcloud.com/stephaniefoo):** I don't know where this one is going, but with each episode Stephanie Foo puts forth an idea for a pilot episode for a new podcast series.
- **[Popaganda](https://bitchmedia.org/feminist-podcasts):** A feminist bend of pop culture. The talk about sports and science and books and everything else.
- **[Sampler](https://gimletmedia.com/show/sampler/):** Another show from Gimlet. This one is about podcasts, and what's going on in the world of podcasting. Meta? Maybe.
- **[Amicus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slates-amicus-dahlia-lithwick/id928790786?mt=2):** I'm oddly fascinated by the Supreme Court.
- **[Strangers](http://www.storycentral.org/strangers/):** Each episode is described as "an empathy shot in your arm" so get ready for the feels.
- **[Surprisingly Awesome](https://soundcloud.com/surprisinglyawesome):** A show about boring things that are surprisingly awesome. My favorite is [about broccoli](https://soundcloud.com/surprisinglyawesome/6-broccoli), but I don't know if it's *surprising* that it's awesome.
- **[The Message](http://themessagepodcast.com/):** Another fictional one. This one is about decoding a message from outer space. Again, start at the beginning.
- **[Mortified](http://getmortified.com/):** Did you keep a journal as a kid? I didn't but I find this experience of people reading their childhood journals on a stage to be incredibly entertaining.
- **[The Pulse](http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/thepulse):** Produced by WHYY, I like the Pennsylvania side of things. It's about science and medicine, but more about the people.
- **[What's the Point?](http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/index):** From FiveThirtyEight, this examines the numbers behind things.
- **[Women of the Hour](https://soundcloud.com/womenofthehour):** I know Lena Dunham can be hit or miss, but I enjoyed every episode of this show.

##Soccer
I'm a big fan of soccer, specifically women's soccer. These podcasts keep me informed about the game.
- **[2 Drunk Fans](http://www.2drunkfans.com/):** It's just soccer, from the viewpoint of two US fans.
- **[Mixxed Zone from Howler](http://whatahowler.podomatic.com/):** Women's soccer from Howler. Good interviews and content.
- **[Women's Soccer Zone](https://audioboom.com/channel/wosozone):** Good coverage of the European leagues.
- **[Women's World Football Show](http://www.wwfshow.com/):** Anything with Becky Sauerbrunn exclusives is worth listening to.
- **[Men in Blazers](http://meninblazers.com/page/podcasts):** Not always, but the interview with [Megan Rapinoe](https://soundcloud.com/meninblazers/men-in-blazers-031116-megan-rapinoe-pod-special) is good to listen to if you're feeling down about your ACL recovery.

##These are good too
- **[How to do everything](http://howtodoeverything.org/):** Little tips on lots of things.
- **[TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/?showDate=2014-11-26):** Sometimes, TED is a bit pretentious. I still catch the Radio Hour from time to time to see if there are new ideas or perspectives on topics that I care about.
- **[Science Friday](http://www.sciencefriday.com/):** I try to time experiments for Friday afternoon, so that I can turn on the radio and listen to Sci Fri. I catch it occasionally in it's podcast form, but, for some reason, enjoy it more live.
- **[Slate: Working](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/working.html):** An in-depth look into people's jobs. Sometimes good. The "Perfumer" episode really annoyed me because she claimed to be very precise in her measurements, but used disposable pipettes. C'mon, girl, get yo'self some eppendorfs ([and use them correctly](http://thatsnothowyoupipette.tumblr.com/)).
- **[The New Yorker: The Political Scene](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/new-yorker-political-scene/):** For when I need some non-NPR, NPR-esque political talk.
- **[Why oh Why](http://wfmu.org/playlists/LK):** The website kind of sucks, but don't let that deter you. Much like Call Your Girlfriend, I feel like I'm with a friend when I listen to this. The PTDD episode is especially applicable to 20-something women.
- **[Slate: Culture Gabfest](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest.html):** Sometimes fun. I listen when I can
- **[Slate: Live at Politics and Prose](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/live_at_politics.html):** Good, if you have time and like the featured author or topic.

# Work Tools
Outside of the lab, my work is all of the computer. I'm constantly tweaking my workspace, but this is what I use for now. Aside from these programs and add-ons, I'm a big fan of the cloud and keep most of my current projects on Dropbox, Box, SkyDrive (or OneDrive), or Google Drive. Each serves a different role in my file-organization system, and I think I finally have my system running as expected. Now that OneDrive offers unlimited storage space, I may need to migrate some files to there. Our lab group uses Google Drive for much of what we do, and it's become an integral part of my reference managing and manuscript writing workflow. I'll try to keep these in a logical order and will certainly add tools as I adapt them to my daily use.
<br><br>

- **[PaperPile](http://paperpile.com):** I was a long-time Mendeley user, and still keep my library on Mendeley up-to-date, but I was frustrated with the product for a few reasons. Some citations wouldn't carry over when I switched computers and others would become jumbled. I had developed a workflow where I would download pdfs and have Mendeley spit them back out into a different folder and rename them as Author-Year-Title, which was nice. What really bothered me, though, was the lack of an Android app that users had been asking for for years, and the inability to use cite-as-you-write in Google Docs. I switched fully to PaperPile about a year ago. It integrates nicely into the google ecosystem, and works with google docs (more on that below). It's not free, but at $2.99 per month for fewer frustrations, I'll take it.
- **[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com):** I still have Microsoft Word, and use it, but have switched to paper and proposal writing in Google Docs. I was sick of the back and forth of a document when it's being worked on by multiple authors, leading to file names that are versioned and out of order. Merging changes never worked well for me. Writing in google docs allows multiple authors to edit at the same time, provides decent version control, and prevents the clogging of my inbox with versions that are being sent back and forth. There are a few places where if falls short of Word, namely in figure placement and image rendering when working with in-line figures. This will hopefully improve with an update, but I still have to go back to Word in my final version to add figures.
- **[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/):** I'm writing this in Notepad++ and use it to assemble any code that I'll run or anything that I just want to write in plain text. I like th tabs and the options that it has to offer, with relatively few unnecessary thrills.
- **[GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/):** Open-source and free 'versions' of Photoshop and Illustrator. I never used the Adobe products much, so I have no problem with the free versions. Yes, they crash sometimes. Yes, it can be frustrating when things don't work. But I've always gotten everything I need to do done with these projects. I use Illustrator to make my scientific posters (and then I print them on fabric using [Spoonflower](http://help.spoonflower.com/customer/portal/articles/1605485-how-to-create-a-fabric-poster-from-a-powerpoint-or-pdf)).
- **[ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) (specifically, [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/Fiji)):** Image analysis and such. I use it all the time. If you're a biologist who does any sort of imaging, I imagine that you do as well. I like using Fiji as my IJ interface as it adds on a few tools that biologists commonly use.
- **[R](http://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/):** This should probably be first on my list as I use it probably more frequently than anything else. I know there are Python devotees out there who would argue that R is garbage, but user statistics speak otherwise. I knew nothing about writing code before I started using R, and now I'm fairly comfortable with it and a few other languages. If I need to do something, I can figure out how to do it in R. Also, using R without Rstudio is just strange. I only do that when I need to update Rstudio from the console, which is quite easy.
- Other things that I use that make things easier, both for work and life, include [Crashplan](http://www.code42.com/crashplan/) for backups, [Fences](http://www.stardock.com/products/fences/) for desktop organization, [LastPass](http://lastpass.com) to organize all of my passwords, and [Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/) for making my desktop look nicer.

# Things on the Internet
I do most of my Internet browsing via my RSS reader. It's like the lazy person's guide to browsing the web. I know some people aren't big on RSS, but it works for me. I now use [Digg Reader](http://digg.com/reader) because I like the simple interface and the Digg Deeper feature. I will, though, always mourn the loss of Google Reader. Other than browsing the NYTimes (which I don't RSS, for some reason) and [FoodGakwer](http://foodgawker.com), I don't really go anywhere else on the Internet (aside from, you know, Facebook and Amazon), so here's a glimpse into my Reader. There are many more than these, but I thought I would highlight a few.
<br><br>

- **[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com), [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com), and [Deadspin](http://deadspin.com):** Though I don't like everything that Gawker media has to offer, I use these three to keep me informed about tech, general life things, and sports. The deals section generally highlights good buys, and I've been steered toward buying products based on recommendations that I've read here.
- **[Nautilus](http://nautil.us/), [Aeon](http://aeon.co/magazine/), [Mosaic](http://mosaicscience.com/):** Longer reads that usually have some science behind them.
- **[R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/):** See my love for R proclaimed above.
- **[Vice](http://vice.com), [Vox](http://vox.com), [Verge](http://theverge.com):** I have no reason to group these together other than the fact that they all start with the letter V.
- **[Pacific Standard](http://psmag.com):** If you don't read it, start. Good, well thought out writing on pertinent topics.
- **[Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/):** Pretty figures. Let me nerd out on this.
- **[Modern Farmer](http://modernfarmer.com/):** Sometimes, a bit too emotional rather than scientific, but usually good.
- **[Buzzfeed](http://buzzfeed.com):** Because puppy videos. Sometimes the articles and food sections are good, but I'm in it mostly for the puppies.

# Real life things
- Coffee made with the [Aeropress](http://www.aeropress.com/). So much easier to clean than a french press. So good.
- Notebooks with grids, not lines. I have no link to this. I don't know why I prefer notebooks with 'graph' as oppoed to lined paper, but I do. It may be that my first PI used these or that I find lab notebooks comforting or that I like to color in the little squares. I feel lost without my grid (don't get me started on the plain blank pages). I recently purchased a [RocketBook](http://igg.me/at/rocketbook/x/9062763) so that I can scan and organize my notes, and then erase the book in the microwave.
- Bicycles. I currently *only* have three, meaning that I have room for more in my collection. I ride a Giant Cypress of some sort that I got on the cheap on a daily basis, and have two roadies for fun times. My current prime stallion, a Cannondale Synapse Carbon, is a beauty, and when I'm away from home, I miss it.
- Rain pants, possibly related to bicycles. Nothing is worse than wet pants, and rain pants are the way to go. Though only dads wear them in the US, everyone wears them in Sweden, which I think is the reason that it's a successful society.
