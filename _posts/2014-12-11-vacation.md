I'm on vacation this week, which is incredibly rare for me. My colleagues in Sweden claim it's because I'm an American, my American friends say it's because I'm a graduate student, and I blame it on conditioning. My family took vacations when I was a kid, but they were laborious affairs that weren't kid friendly (wine tastings) or were terrifying (I'm looking at you [Acadia National Park Precipice Hike](http://www.citrusmilo.com/acadiaguide/precipicetrail.cfm)). I've taken a few days off here and there, usually on either end of conference trips to visit friends and explore different areas. This trip, to Stockholm and Paris, is with my mom, who would never make the trip alone, but loves having me along as a tour guide and trip planner. It's a gift to her, giving her a chance to explore a new area. So is this still really a vacation for me? I'll call it that, though it may be a wolf in sheep's clothing.

#### Grad students and vacation
In my department/lab/university, vacation policies vary depending on the adviser. Most people I know have fairly lax policies and clearly communicate their vacation plans. No one that I know has a problem. I've never been made aware of an official grad student vacation policy, and it doesn't seem as though one exists. There's an old question on [Stack Exchange](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/11336/how-much-vacation-time-is-typical-during-a-phd-in-the-united-states) that addresses this, and the conclusion seems to be the same. My coworkers in Sweden have official vacation days (around 30) throughout their PhD, but they also are more strict about coming to lab every day and not coming on weekends. That is, they treat it like a normal job.

#### In the news
Recently, graduate teaching assistants at the University of Oregon have been making the news for their protests about the university's insufficient maternity leave (see this [link](http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/32538159-75/uo-graduate-staff-reach-tentative-agreement.html.csp#). Since they came to an agreement, I'm guessing the new regulations are satisfactory, though I know little about this. At Penn State, we have leave protections, and I know quite a few graduate students who have had children, though, especially for women, it's a struggle. This is in stark contrast to Sweden, where graduate students get full parental leave (14 months!) with paid benefits. What's the best? I don't know, though I may explore this more in the future.

I should go vacation now. Here's Stockholm.
