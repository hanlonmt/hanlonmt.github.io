Things I've liked this week!

It's Christmastime, so I liked that and very little else. I've been taking the Swedish approach and actually not working, for the most part. I've been responding to emails from American colleagues, because America. I only have a few things to share.

##### [The New Yorker: Pain really does make us gain](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/pain-really-make-us-gain)
My teammates and I used to always joke that having a mutual enemy (our coach) made us closer. Maybe it was the grueling practices that actually did that? 

##### [There'a a biking gender gap. And it has a real economic impact](http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/economic-empowerment/there-s-a-biking-gender-gap-and-it-has-a-real-economic-impact-20141208?ref=t.co&mrefid=walkingheader)
Why don't women bike? It's a question explored frequently by bike bloggers, and now pops up in the national journal. Making our streets more bike friendly would benefit those who need it most.

That's it. Happy holidays!
