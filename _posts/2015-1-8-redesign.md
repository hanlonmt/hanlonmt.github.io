I spent a few months with my old website, but soon decided that I was sick of it. This was mainly due to the fact that I didn't like supplying "teaser" or thumbnail images to each post. I also wanted my landing page to contain multiple posts. I redesigned, using the [HPSTR theme](http://mademistakes.com/articles/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) from [Made Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com/). I'm still in the tweaking phase and would like to add some new features, but everything should be working. I also re-worked my sharing tools, so facebook and twitter sharing should use the correct images. This was harder than I anticipated it being, but I know a great deal more about the inner-workings of my site. My header images are still a little weird on some of my posts (likely due to image size), but I may or may not fix that. I'm all into moving forward, here.

Another feature I've added is a collection of R-related posts. Right now, the collection is sparse, but I want to slowing add pieces to it that I use on a regular basis. This will serve both as a personal repository and a point-of-reference for others (including people in my lab). The links to the R section can be found in the side bar, or by going directly to the [posts](http://mollyhanlon.com/Rposts/) and [archives](http://mollyhanlon.com/Rarchive/) of R. I'd like to (eventually) get things up and running a bit better in my GitHub repository, then I will share code through that. one thing at a time.

The above-mentioned sharing tools are a bit hidden, unless you're on a post-specific page. If that's the case, then they should pop up on the left and stay there as you scroll. They look like this:

That's all for now. Until I write something of substance, please enjoy everything else.
