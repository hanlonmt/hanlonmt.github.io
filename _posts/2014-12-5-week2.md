Things I've liked this week!

### [Intelligence Squared US: Genetically Modify Food](http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/1161-genetically-modify-food)
This is near and dear to my heart, and I'm planning to write a more in-depth reflection next week. If you're not familiar with the IQ2 debates, then start listening. The debates pit experts against each other in a moderated debate on a single topic. The most recent was on genetically modified food. My only gripe is with the moderator (who I normally like) because he rejected Nina Federoff's question and accepted Bill Nye's, who is notably anti-GM. 

### [The secret history of cars begins with bicycles](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/12/the-secret-history-of-cars-begins-with-bicycles/383254/)
I love bicycles and stories about their history. Bikes are great equalizers and emancipators. We need to appreciate them more, America.

### [Marketplace: York and Fig](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german)
I listen to Marketplace nearly every day in lab, and they've been doing a special series on gentrification in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. They seek different prospectives on the matter and highlight the good and the bad of gentrification. If you like 'hip' areas of cities but haven't (or have) considered what this does to the community that was pushed out, take a look at this series.

Everyone needs puppies.
