According to some, we've been [doing science all our lives](http://www.wired.com/2011/09/little-kids-are-natural-scientists/). I like that idea, but I don't want to think about 6-year old me trying to do what I do on a day to day basis. So what does that mean? What do I do on a normal day?
<br><br>
That's difficult to say, because there is no *normal* day. Today was a lab day; yesterday, mostly a data analysis day. Some days are writing days, and those just look like I'm staring at a computer. When I'm in my home lab, there are greenhouse days and field days and all sorts of combinations of all of these. But, for nothing other than reference, here's my day: Wednesday, 26 November, 2014.
<br><br>
**7:45 AM (ish):** arrive to lab, get settled, grab some coffee, check and respond to emails, check to-do list for the day
<br>
**8:30 AM:** department/centre meeting to discuss the state of things
<br>
**9:30 AM:** start lab work. Today I had to do some extractions from plant tissue that I collected a few weeks ago. This involves a number of steps, including the main extraction step (essentially beating the tissue into oblivion, see the video), followed by a series of separation steps on columns in an attempt to leave behind all of the stuff we don't want and keep all of the things I want to analyze.

<br>
**1:00 PM:** Grab a quick lunch between centrifugation steps. In the protocol that I follow, I have some steps that take about 30 minutes, so I managed to squeeze in a quick lunch. Lunch time at this centre varies from 11:30 AM to 2 PM, so there's always someone to eat with in the lunch room. Today's conversations included: should English really be the language of science? Why does French have so many specific words? How does airline pricing work? And what does it really mean when something is too sweet? We have riveting conversations, as you can see.
<br>
**1:30 PM:** Back to the lab to finish up my extractions. I only had 22 samples today, so I wasn't in a huge rush and did a few other things while completing my extractions.
<br>
**4:00 PM:** Submit my samples for analysis. I'm analyzing my tissue for certain hormones, and this is done using GC-MS/MS (gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (twice!)). This uses all sorts of high tech and fancy machinery that I won't go into here. It's actually even a bit over my head, but luckily I work with a bunch of smart people who understand it better than I do.

<br>
**4:15 PM ish:** To my computer to write emails and take care of random requests that have come in. I also went to check on some plants that I have growing and used their progress to gauge when I'll have to do my next set of tissue collections. I also used this time to organize my day and plan for tomorrow.
<br>
**5:30 PM:** To the gym! I have a swimming competition next week with the group I train with. It's my first competition since college (eek!), so I need to get a bit more training in before that.
<br><br>
That's a day in my life. Some days I get to work earlier, some later. The make-up of each day differs, but this is what I scientist does because I did it, and I'm a scientist.
<br>
The end.
