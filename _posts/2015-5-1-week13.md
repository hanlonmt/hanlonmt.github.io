### [NYMag: Chipotle Is Promoting Opportunistic Anti-Science Hysteria](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/04/chipotle-is-promoting-anti-science-hysteria.html)

This week, Chipotle [announced that they are going to cook with non-GMO ingredients](https://chipotle.com/gmo). The media has been surprisingly pro-science on this, with articles from [NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2015/04/30/403249551/why-we-cant-take-chipotles-gmo-announcement-all-that-seriously) and the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/burrito-bunkum/2015/04/29/a4cd8382-ed18-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html) calling them out on it. This article from Jessie Ingal calls Chipotle out for evoking emotion and hysteria along the lines of the anti-vaccine movement. 

### [NYTimes: How I got converted to G.M.O. food](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/25/opinion/sunday/how-i-got-converted-to-gmo-food.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0)

Mark Lynas, a previously outspoken anti-GMO environmental activist has recently changed his mind, and penned this op-ed in the NY Times to explain his position. His main thesis:

> After writing two books on the science of climate change, I decided I could no longer continue taking a pro-science position on global warming and an anti-science position on G.M.O.s.

### [Al Jazeera America: Marijuana's magic bean men](http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2015/4/30/marijuana-breeding-pioneers.html)

An interesting read about the guys who breed the most popular strains of American marijuana. I often think about how legalization (which seems inevitable) will restructure this industry, change agriculture, and alter the horticultural practices. I know, it's a totally nerdy perspective, but think about it!
