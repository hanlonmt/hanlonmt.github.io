I'm really trying to be a good mentor to the new students in the lab; teaching them where things are, introducing them to the right people, and letting them in on all of the little secrets that I wish someone had told me. Of course, we've had other new students in the lab between when I started and now, but both of these students are working on projects that follow-up on my work. I worked on the grants that fund them, and I feel obligated to help them out. One of the things that I'm doing is teaching them R, sharing all of my code, and letting them see what I do (both the good and the bad). It's a teaching step that I wish I had had: coding can be tough for a biologist to learn, but having someone else's code as a template to figure out what goes on is a great tool. 

After our R lesson last week, I started to show them some "cool" things that you can do with R that aren't related to science, like looking at [publication trends](http://mollyhanlon.com/journal_titles/) or [funding trends](http://mollyhanlon.com/funding1/). I followed this by saying, "I swear I wasn't a nerd until I started grad school."
<br>

They didn't believe me. That made me wonder, how did I end up here?

<br>

## The beginning


I was a weird child, but now that I've seen a lot of children, I've concluded that all children are weird. By that metric, I was normal. I had friends, was social, did well in school, but always settled in comfortably on some edge of mainstream. In high school, I continued to do well in school (they even gave me a trophy!), but high school was pretty easy. I never stayed up past 10 PM doing homework, and was only ever up late because of some athletic or social event. I wasn't in any real clubs that weren't related to sports, aside from National Honor Society, had no musical inclinations, and really was a horrible 'good' student. 
<br>

I conspired with my gifted teacher to allow me to do a science project at our local college. I never did it. I just left school every day to 'attend to my science project' and went out to lunch or just ran around town. I skipped class under the guise of some extra academic activity far too often. I had nearly half of my day as study halls in my senior year, and one of my 'real' classes was PE. When my math teacher encouraged me to participate in a math competition, I told her that I preferred to be well-rounded and went to swim practice instead. I went to prom and homecoming and parties. In the end, I graduated at the top of my class with 12 varsity letters, the first female to do the latter in the history of my school. I was set.

## College

I started, and almost finished, college as a pre-med student. I never had the 'I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR' mentality, but there are a lot of scholarships out there for people who want to become doctors, and I figured I could probably do it. I took hard classes (that happens when you're a biochemistry major and creative writing minor), and got decent, but not spectacular grades. I could have probably done better, but I spent 20 hours/week swimming for most of the year while working as a lifeguard, tour guide, and TA. 
<br>

I started working in lab when my parents told me that I couldn't come home that summer and return to being a swim coach and bartender. I worked in a lab, but so did many science majors. I was, still, 'liberal-arts cool.' I was an athlete, had many friends in the right groups of Greek Life, and spent more time at parties that I probably should have. I was all set to become a doctor - I even did fine on the MCATs - but then I realized that I actually didn't want to do that. A bunch of things happened. Then I ended up in grad school.

## I'm not nerdy enough for this!

Different fields of study certainly attract different people. Plant biology is a weird one. There are very few people who, at a young age, want to grow up and be a plant biologist. I wanted to be everything but a plant biologist and even told my parents that I had 'plant sickness' to avoid eating vegetables or mowing the grass. Going into plant biology is usually a very calculated choice and people don't happen on it just because. Biomedical research is a completely different story. Somehow, I ended up doing this and teaching a paper doll about pH standards.

I often find myself in conversations where I have no idea what's happening. I didn't ever take a computer science course. I've seen *Star Wars*, but that's all I can say about it. The most 'intense' board game I've ever played was Pictionary. I don't know what people are talking about when they talk about being nerdy in high school or college. To all of my friends who stuck with the pre-med track and went on to become doctors, I'm their weird friend. To everyone in grad school, I'm some odd, mainstream spectacle.

Google had no autocompletes for "plant biolgists are" or "plant scientists are," but botanists did have an entry:

I don't really know how it happened, but I'll still tell everyone that I was a cool kid, even if I was always destined to become a weird plant biologist:
