I was having breakfast with some friends yesterday and we were discussing weddings. One of my friends, in her mid-thirties, married, with a kid, was talking about how they already have 4 weddings on their summer docket. When do people stop getting married? This led to a discussion about name-changing. Though a PhD student when she got married, she changed her name mostly due to not wanting to carry her dad's name. She said, "Changing my name goes against all of my feminist ideals, but so does carrying the name of my dad, who I never even knew and was an abusive jerk." The weirdest thing about it? Re-learning how to sign her name.
<br><br>
I don't have any personal stories to add to this, though for professional (publication) and personal (I *like* my name) reasons, I wouldn't change my name if I were to get married. I also realize that this discussion is cis-leaning. I couldn't find much data about same-sex marriages, but this [2013 article in the Atlantic spells it out pretty well](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/for-same-sex-couples-changing-names-takes-on-extra-significance/279841/), stating that having the same last name can help with the feeling of familial cohesion. There are also lots of stories out there about couples trying to change their names but being denied due to inane state laws, and the [SSA has a run-down of states](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0110212035) where name-change due to same-sex marriage can be validated.
<br><br>
That was a bit of a tangent, but I wanted to explore the relationship between name-changing practices and academia. The commonly circulating wisdom is that female academics don't change their name *especially* if they have publications with their old name. I know plenty of people who have changed their names, and some professors who have gone through multiple name changes, due to combinations of divorce and re-marriage. I went searching to figure out what actually happens.
<br><br>
I found this [interesting piece in Pacific Standard](http://www.psmag.com/books-and-culture/the-missus-marriage-gender-feminism-names-62460), claiming that people perceive women who keep their name to be more "intelligent, competent, and ambitious." The problem? This study was retracted a few months after this. I couldn't find the retraction notice, so I don't know what was really wrong with the paper. An article in the Harvard Medical Student Review breaks this down even further, and displays some data from an earlier (2004) collection and results from a survey of the Harvard Medical School Class of 2017, where 65% of students state a preference to keep their maiden name:

[That 2004 study](http://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/files/making_a_name_womens_surnames_at_marriage_and_beyond.pdf) showed a strong correlation between education and name-retention, with woman with a PhD having the strongest correlation with not changing her name. A homemaker with children is the most likely to change her name. There have been numerous interesting studies on why women change their name (see [here](http://file.scirp.org/Html/39903.html), [here](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2009/00000037/00000005/art00014?token=004b1740a609c5d7e2a46762c6b665d7d663c70502e564624673f7b2f267738703375686f49), and [here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/4495622.pdf?acceptTC=true), just to get started).
<br><br>
You may say "2004, that was over 10 years ago! What about now?" There isn't a current comprehensive study that I could find that would help me answer my questions. Facebook, though has collected some data and generated this graphic:

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/data/posts/10151609136028415:0"><img src="http://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/922616_10151609136003415_9266270_o.png" alt="Facebook Data Science"></a>

which shows that women in their 20s and 30s are less likely to take their husband's name in marriage, and hyphenation is also falling off. Granted, this data comes from Facebook, where naming isn't bound by law and isn't completely accurate. This is discussed in [this Mic article](http://mic.com/articles/55317/more-women-are-keeping-their-own-names-after-marriage-says-facebook), which also says that 61% of respondents to a YouGov poll say that women *should* change their name with marriage. I looked up a [YouGov poll](https://today.yougov.com/news/2014/10/20/last-names/), though, and found some different numbers ([full results](http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/7rbgiwpoe2/tabs_OPI_last_names_20141016.pdf)). The majority of people agree - do what you want:

<br>
There are quite a few blog posts and other things on the internet about what women in academia do ([here](https://womeninplanetaryscience.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/to-change-your-name-or-not-to-change-your-name-options-for-married-scientists/), [here](http://gradschool.about.com/od/forwomen/a/Should-You-Change-Your-Name-After-Getting-Married.htm), and [here](https://lists.anl.gov/pipermail/wisttalk/2014-May/002148.html)). Again, there's not a strong consensus, and do what you want seems to be the most commong choice. If you have a [highly unfortunate last name](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/thanks-mom-and-dad#.oiJzdY05o), then, by all means, change your name.

Unrelated (kind of): [this 2011 infographic from National Geographic](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/02/geography/usa-surnames-interactive) helps you see what the most common names in regions of America are. It's cool.

<br>
The Mic piece says that the average age of marriage is 27. My adviser asked if I felt old the other day when I said that all of my friends were having kids. 

...

I guess I'll get back to my plants now.
