I often see and hear people discussing GMOs, bolstering their opinions with scientifically invalid arguments. This has led me to ask myself what role scientists should have as advocates, activists, educators, or communicators.

## The plant science precipice

We're at an important time for plant science. People seem to care about their food and are listening to information from sources like the [Food Babe](http://gawker.com/the-food-babe-blogger-is-full-of-shit-1694902226). [Chipotle just banned GMOs](https://chipotle.com/gmo), and Jesse Signal argues that we're heading down the same [anti-vaxx slippery slope](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2015/04/chipotle-is-promoting-anti-science-hysteria.html?mid=facebook_nymag). [The general public and scientists disagree immensely on the safety of GMOs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/01/29/5-key-findings-science/). Jane Goodall, one of the most publicly-visible scientists of the past 30 or so years, [is anti-GM](http://kuer.org/post/goodall-gmo-s-i-truly-believe-we-re-poisoning-ourselves).

This all makes me sad.

Are we, as plant scientists, poor communicators? Poor advocates? Not as great at being activists as the anti-GM side?

Most of us became plant scientists because we're fascinated with the living things around us, are extremely curious, and want to use these skills and characteristics to make the world a better place. Everyone I know strives to feed more people, to fuel our lives more cleanly, or to maintain (or improve) the health of earth. I know no one who is in it to make money. I know no one who is in it for fame or even just for fun (see [this earlier post](http://mollyhanlon.com/inferiority/)). We want to have a positive impact on the world, even if we know it's an uphill battle. What should we do?

## The argument for advocacy

A lot of scientists who I know claim to not have time for advocacy, and I agree that we're already stretched thin with regards to time. To me, this is a bit of a cop-out. Do we not, as scientists, have an obligation to society, the society which enables us to be scientists, to educate? As publicly-funded researchers, we're supposed to have broader impacts - how broad are these if they're only to educate students? Isn't that our job as educators within a university system?

In regards to climate change, scientists have both [kept silent](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/science/earth/06profile.html?_r=0) and served as [advocates](). Their place is debated, though most things I have read [conclude that scientists should speak up](http://www.npr.org/blogs/13.7/2014/10/16/356543981/when-is-it-ok-for-scientists-to-become-political). I think of it this way: if my physician tells me that I'm sick, I want him or her to provide me with a treatment plan and advise that I follow it. I don't want to be diagnosed, told options exist, and then told to listen to someone else. 

Whether or not we, as scientists, have a moral argument to be activists or advocates is debatable. I struggle with it in my mind. [John Vucetich and Michael Nelson argue both sides of the debate more eloquently than I do](http://www.humansandnature.org/the-moral-obligations-of-scientists-article-108.php): 

> Still, the commitments to society override one's commitments to science. When scientists reject advocacy as a principle, they reject a fundamental aspect of their citizenship. Because of the nature and depth of their knowledge, they have a special responsibility. It is a perversion of democracy to muffle the voice of the most knowledgeable among us and consequently amplify the voice of those with the greatest ignorance. Silencing scientists who wish to be honest and open advocates promotes mob rule by special interests. Although some might think that scientists have inadequate breadth of knowledge to appropriately engage in advocacy-that only policy-makers and managers should enjoy such a privilege-that logic would exclude virtually every citizen from advocacy, a prospect as absurd as it is dangerous.

## What should I do?

I have no plans to become an activist and spend my time protesting. I plan on continuing to be a productive scientist AND advocating for implementation of my findings to improve the greater good. If only it were that simple.

I think one of the difficulties that arises is that we, as scientists, are used to basing our arguments on facts and data. Many anti-GMO activists favor emotion over fact(see [this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/12/04/364745790/food-babe-or-fear-babe-as-activist-s-profile-grows-so-do-her-critics), [this](http://www.onthemedia.org/story/what-does-body-good/), and [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-food-babe-enemy-of-chemicals/385301/)).

There's also the potential for trouble. All of us have been accused of being a shill. I am, actually, not a shill. I'm a graduate student. [Dr. Kevin Folta](https://gmoanswers.com/experts/kevin-folta), a professor of horticulture put this figure on [his blog](http://kfolta.blogspot.com/) to help you decide if someone is a shill:

Unfortunately, people have accused Kevin Folta of being more than just a shill. [He's been served with FOIA requests](http://blog.aspb.org/2015/04/28/foias-chilling-a-scientific-dialog-your-call-to-communicate/) due to his involvement with GMO answers, a corporate-backed website that allows the public and scientists to engage about GMOs. He ends his story of this debacle with this: 

> We are living in a time when applications of technology for agriculture and medicine will only come faster, and new breakthroughs will coincidentally kindle newfound resistance.  A malleable, comfortable, and scientifically un-savvy public will bend to activist-manufactured risk.  To move science's discoveries from the laboratory to widely accepted application will require all of our participation, and communicating with a curious public must become a priority mission for us as scientists.

As in individual scientist, the degree to which you engage the public is a moral and ethical judgement that you must make as an individual. I think my personal stance is clear, is yours?
