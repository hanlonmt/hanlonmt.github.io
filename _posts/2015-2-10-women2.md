I want to be an advocate for women in science and harness all of my feminist energy towards the field that I love.
<br><br>
But I seem to stink at it.
<br><br>
I've tried to do things with our local chapter of graduate women in science, and I've tried attending special dinners and lunches for women in science. As an undergraduate, I got into a disagreement with the keynote speaker at one such event when she said it wasn't the role of scientists to advocate and push for change. She said nearly the exact same thing in this [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/science/earth/06profile.html?_r=0) from 2007:

>"I can only give you something that’s going to disappoint you, sir, and that is that it’s my personal scientific approach to say it’s not my role to try to communicate what should be done."

I'm not the only one who had misgivings about this (see [here](http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/fresh-views-on-climate-scientists-as-advocates/)). She was touted as one of the foremost women in science, and then kind of said that it wasn't her job to be sure that the science actually resulted in change. I won't debate the ethics of this, but I just know that it didn't sit right with 21-year old me.

A few months later, I was at another conference and hear Arlene Blum speak. She was the woman in science hero that I had been looking for. She published a [series of articles in the late 1970s](http://greensciencepolicy.org/our-publications/) pointing out the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of compounds commonly used as flame retardants in children's sleepwear and bedding. She spoke about the challenges of getting her PhD in biophysical chemistry in the late 70s and how being a mother changed her outlook on science. She was eloquent and interesting. She was, to 21-year old me, everything I wanted to be.
<br><br>
And then I went to grad school. I attended all of the events put on by our chapter of Graduate Women in Science. At all of them, I was told about the statistics of women in science. They were all depressing and informative. None of them gave me any insight about *what* to actually do. I've written previously about being a woman in science and my experience [here](http://themthroot.com/women1), but I still don't have an answer.
<br><br>
A recent [article in the NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/upshot/is-the-professor-bossy-or-brilliant-much-depends-on-gender.html?abt=0002&abg=1) showed that students were more likely to call male professors brilliant and female professors bossy.

All of this makes me think that we'll never *really* overcome the gender bias. So what is it that we should do? Keep working hard and pushing until we're recognized as equals? Speak up and be advocates in our individual fields? Attend GWIS events just to say 'I'm here' even if they're super boring? Watch [Emma Watson speak to the UN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkjW9PZBRfk) over and over? 
<br><br>
I think all we can do, everyone, is stop being jerks. It's the simplest way to improve, to create a better society, to improve our workplace, and to advance science. I wish it was that simple, to just say that and to fix everything. Maybe, someday, we'll get there. Until then, just prepare yourself for Galentine's Day.
