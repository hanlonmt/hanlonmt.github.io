There's been lot's of good stuff this week as everyone climbs out of their holiday slumber. Here's what's topping my list:

### [The Most Popular Dog Names of 2014](http://www.rover.com/blog/2014-popular-dog-names/)
Surprise, Molly comes in at number 4! When I meet people, they frequently tell me that they have a dog named Molly. I've started telling them that my dog has their name. Does it? No, and I don't even have a dog, but I hope it puts into perspective that the "dog name" reaction isn't the best. Also, who names their dog Kale?

### [Fertility fog: Women in their 30s and 40s exhibit a mix of wishful thinking and woeful ignorance when it comes to their fertility. Why?](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/why-do-women-know-so-little-about-their-own-fertility/)
One of the best popular pieces related to women's health that I've read in a while. From egg-freezing to fertility peaks, women don't know a lot about what's going on. Amy Klein reveals popular opinions, busts myths, and tells the truth about what it takes to have a baby.

### [The secret history of women in the senate](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/senate-women-secret-history-113908.html#.VK-I0ivF-So)
A look at what our female senators have endured over the years, and the issues that still persist today. The ending is great, and reminds me of a [post I wrote not long ago](http://mollyhanlon.com/women1):  

> Collins looked across the room. "And then sitting at the witness table, I have an array of high-ranking officials from the Department of Defense, including the secretary of defense. And not one of them was a female."  
Depressing? Sure. But for that moment, at least, that's not how it registered for Collins.  
"The great thing was," she says, "I was in charge."


### [The Strange Inevitability of Evolution](http://nautil.us/issue/20/creativity/the-strange-inevitability-of-evolution)
Science writing, at it's finest. This piece explains how the gene to phenotype pathway isn't as simple as we present it to be. With regulation at RNA and protein levels, as well as complex gene regulatory networks, this pathway is more of a walk in the woods without a trail. It's no news to any biologist, but it's nice to see it presented to the public this way.
