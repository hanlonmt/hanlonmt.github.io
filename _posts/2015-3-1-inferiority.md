I'm taking a course to get extra training in research ethics. It's been an enjoyable and thought-provoking experience. Last week, I sat down with the instructor to discuss the course's project (in which I'll be examining different aspects of publication), and she started the conversation by saying "I notice that you're always having to defend yourself as a plant biologist."
<br><br>
I laughed. I know this is true, and I know that it's true for nearly all plant biologists. Why do we do this and what does it mean?

## The Plant Biology Inferiority Complex

Food. Fiber. Fuel.

We repeat these three words to ourselves often. We know the facts relating to world hunger and malnutrition and global warming and so on. We still qualify our profession to others with the word just: I'm *just* a plant biologist. Why?

For me, it's a defense mechanism. I was never supposed to be a plant biologist, but a medical doctor, and I disappointed a lot of people when I decided upon my current career (mostly my parents; they've gotten over it). My friends never tire of making fun of me for my odd choice of profession. Despite their knowledge of the importance, they still heckle me. When someone is good at science, they're encouraged to be doctors or to 'cure cancer,' but never to become a plant scientist. This may mean that our field is [missing out on some of the best minds in science](http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2011/7889.html). You know who was a plant biologist? Right, [Darwin](http://www.plantcell.org/content/23/4/1194.full).

Many other important scientific discoveries have happened in plants, from the discovery of the cell to Mendel's pea plants to transposable elements and RNAi. Science wouldn't be where it is today without all of those discoveries. They're a great experimental system, and we still have a lot to learn. 

Some may say that I feel this way because I'm just a trainee. That's also not true. Last year at the ASPB national meeting, both David Baulcombe and Pamela Ronald, two very, *very* prominent plant biologists brought the issue up. Other experienced plant biologists also told me that they think our community is harder to be successful in, not because of competition, but because we know the systems well and don't let things slide through peer review. We also don't publish as prolifically because we think that if it's not perfect, no one will care (the inferiority complex at it's finest). I have no evidence to back this up, but it is an interesting anecdote.

## Plant Blindness 

Our inferiority complex as plant biologists may stem from society's views of plants. See this [article on plant blidness](http://articles.philly.com/2014-09-13/news/53855438_1_plants-botanists-blindness) and this TEDxSBU talk by Margaret Conover about plant blindness. The talk is wonderful:

People favor animals over plants (I'm guilty of this), but people also like chocolate better than medicine, but we don't dismiss the latter. Educators need to give plants the prominent position they deserve in lessons, but I understand the difficulty in doing this, especially as kids find pretty much everything boring.

## Moving forward

I'll probably never [win a Nobel Prize](http://www.howplantswork.com/2012/10/11/want-a-nobel-prize-dont-study-plants/) or gain much fame, but I'm going to keep marching forward, trying to understand the plants that are all around us. I'll probably continue be unappreciated and unfunded, but I'll be unapologetic about it and follow the wisdom of that quote that we all saw as kids:

> Stand for what you believe in even if you're standing alone.

I'll also, maybe, put googly eyes on things, because that makes everything better.
