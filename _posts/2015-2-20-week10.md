### [What is the point of plants? BBC4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b052hptj)

The hosts of The Infinite Monkey Cage, Brian Cox and Robin Ince, are joined by some plant people to discuss one of my favorite things. If you're any sort of scientist, and especially a plant scientist, take 30 minutes to listen. It's entertaining!

### [PS Mag: When It Comes to IVF, Who Should Call the Shots?](http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/ivf-fertility-ethics-dilemma-in-vitro)

I don't have a strong opinion on IVF because each case is unique and a blanket statement can't be made. Is it something I would do? No, probably not, but that's possibly because I don't like babies and I have no desire to make my own babies. This piece grabbed my attention, though, because it highlights the ethical challenges that arise when experts don't agree. If there isn't a consensus at the top, then who gets to make the call about right and wrong?

### [Aeon Mag: Where are all the women hermits?](http://aeon.co/magazine/society/where-are-all-the-women-hermits/)

Being a hermit: not for me. I like to talk to people too much. Sure, I like the woods and foraging for food and making fires and stuff, but I wouldn't gain happiness by 
secluding myself in the woods for an extended period. We look at women and men, *who do the same thing*, very differently, and I think this piece just begins that conversation. The ending is thought provoking:

> A woman alone, unwatched, unchaperoned and without children is impossible for us to process. What does she do with her time? Burn the witch. She doesn't exist. But what of those women who, against all odds, refuse these rules?

### [The Unsinkable R.B.G.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/opinion/sunday/gail-collins-ruth-bader-ginsburg-has-no-interest-in-retiring.html?smid=tw-share)

Because RBG for life.
