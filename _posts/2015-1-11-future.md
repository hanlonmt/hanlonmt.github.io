Most grad students fear the "when will you be done" question. I don't, generally, because "within a year or so" usually suffices, and isn't really a lie. The question that I have a hard time answering is "What are you going to do when you finish?" I usually shrug it off and say that I'm just focused on *getting* my Ph.D and my future isn't my greatest concern.
<br><br>
That's obviously a lie.
<br><br>
I think about what getting a Ph.D means for my future frequently. I hear horror stories and everything about the future of science seems dismal. That being said, I can't see myself not being involved in science or plant biology in any way. What does this mean for me?

## The potential
ASCB, the American society of cell biology, published this infographic, showing that some people get stuck in an infinite post-doc loop, and the tenure track career is only for a small percentage of Ph.D earners. It is, in reality, the alternative career.

<br><br>

Careers in plant science are a bit different than those of other, specifically biomedical, science career tracks. Sure, I can follow the grad school to post-doc to academia route, and that is no different. What is different is a large chunk of the alternatives: industry. 
<br><br>
In a response to all of the "too many PhDs" problem, Alan Jones, ASPB president, penned a [piece in the Scientist](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41133/title/Opinion--The-Planet-Needs-More-Plant-Scientists/) claiming that the glut of PhDs doesn't apply to plant scientists, where demand is greater than supply. The comments completely disagree with this, and I'm sure there are plent of job-less plant scientists who have their own anecdotes. Since this is my blog, I'm going to ask: what does this mean for me?
<br><br>
Let's assume there are four large branches post-PhD: academia, industry, government, and other. It looks a little something like this:

I've boxed in three things, two in blue (academia:research and government:policy) as two things I've been told that I should do. My initial goal (academia:teaching) is in orange. Other, the black box, is just that. There are all sorts of things there: writing, start-ups, careers totally outside of science. I'm not going to explore this in depth - there's plenty of other conversation elsewhere about this. 

## What I *should* do
I've been told time and time again that I should be a professor: by friends, colleagues, advisors, and everyone in between. What makes me seem professorial? I have no idea. I do wear glasses and cardigans, so I imagine that's a key reason. I've been given the following reasons: hard-working, enjoys teaching, stubborn, and competitve. You know, positive qualitites. All of the people who have told me these things know me well, and we respect each other. I want to believe them and take their advice. My undergraduate advisor thinks I should go into government policy, mainly because I like to talk a lot and force people to listen to me. I don't know if this necessarily fits, but she's been insisting that that is the career track for me for well over five years.

## What I *want* to do
When I first started grad school, I had the plan to make my way to a small, undergraduate, liberal arts institution and teach. I love the liberal arts model and the education at small schools. I think I would still love this career tract. The problem? I worry that many of these small schools are not sustainable, and we will see a dramatic change in their functioning models in the near future. With tuitions around $50,000 per year, the finincial burden is too high for the majority of students, meaning only a small percentage of the population will have access to such an education. If this is the case, is that where I want to teach? And will these people even want to learn about plants? In my experience, no, students don't like plants. My own sister, a cell biologist, told me that she hated her plant courses, and this is a sentiment I've heard from many. Can we make the plant science education experience better? If we do, will these students have a career at the end?

## What do others do?
I wanted to get some data to explore this, to figure out where plant biology PhD graduates go. The NSF completes surverys that ask these type of questions, but their data isn't really all available. Some of it is there, but they go between specific and non-specific filters. I'm not really interested in data on all biological science or agricultural science graduates. I'm not looking an animal science, nor am I looking at human genetics. They have this data, i just can't quite get to it to use the specifically filtered data to fulfill my own curiosity. Maybe we need more data, and it might be up to us to collect it. More on this (maybe) in the future.

## What will I do?
I don't know. For now, I'm just going to work on getting my PhD.
