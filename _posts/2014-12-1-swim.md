*This is part 1 of a series that will show up frequently on this blog.*

I've made the argument a few times in my career that swimming, more than many of my courses prepared me for a career in research. It wasn't the countless hours of tedium (though that helped) nor the ability to brush off the harshest criticisms that a coach could throw my way, but that through swimming I learned how to be resiliant.

I have more competitive swim seasons under my belt than fingers to count on (toes, too!), and when I took my cap and goggles off after my last real race as a competitor, the emotions were complex. I felt an odd mix of relief, sadness, and joy in the moment, but less than a week later, I was itching to get back in the water (also itching because of the chlorine-induced dry skin). In my retirement years, something keeps bringing me back to the pool at odd hours, in all types of weather, because I just can't give up. Any time I've travelled, I've found a pool to ground myself, telling anyone I meet that 25 meters is 25 meters anywhere in the world. Though few things remain constant in the life of a young academic, this does, and it helps me feel at home wherever I am. Getting a dose of 'black line therapy' reinvigorates me, grounds me, and energizes me.

For some of us, that may parallel science careers - there are breaks, time away, but that pull always brings us back, seeking fulfillment through the scientific process. It wasn't this dependent relationship that prepared me for the seeming drudgery of grad school, but the grind of swimming that makes the grind of grad school seem normal.

Granted, I swam at an NCAA DIII institution, far from the throes of big name sports. We still practiced 20 hours a week, 19 weeks per year (minimum), from late September to early spring. Through the winters, 5:30 AM alarms forced us out of bed, trudging through the snow, to jump in a cold pool. Combined with work study, a TA position, and a full course load, there were weeks where I was pulled thin, but whatever I had left was left in the pool day in and day out. I was never a stellar swimmer, and only turned to the sport when a knee injury ended my soccer days, but my competitive drive helped me to never give up, no matter how hard (read: ridiculous) the set was. Throughout those 19 weeks, we, as a team, loved and hated each other more than even the closest of families. We had all seen each other in our worst states - physically and emotionally exhausted, overwhelmed by classes and the college social scene, and drained to a point where changing clothes was a chore that couldn't be undertaken (OK, maybe we were a bit lazy at times).

What makes the swim season different from most other sports is that you don't typically perform well or get better, to the casual observer, throughout the season. Heavy weights, innumberable pull ups and body weight exercises, and ~~yardage~~ mileage in the pool wears a body down. With a short season, that leaves little time to recover. For 14 (or so), of those 19 weeks, our coaches beat us up. We were yelled at, kicked out of practice and off the team for bouts of laziness, forced to manage our time so that sacrafices became neccesities. Life wasn't busy, it just was. Days were scheduled, sleep compromised, yet practices were set in stone. Each lap, when not contemplating survival, the question of why often crossed my mind, and to each why, I only said because there was no other way - this was my thing. And throughout that whole season, we wouldn't really get better, but there would be small victories. Closing practice with 8x25 UW on 0:40 went from being difficult to being a breeze, a common 20x100 test set morphed with the last group slimming down by more than 10 seconds from the beginning of the season to the end. The victories were muddled with defeat, though, and attitudes didn't lift much.

And then, magically, the time would arrive. That time that we had waited for, yeared for, dreamt about, had come. Taper. The most beautiful word to any swimmer. Taper is, in grad school lingo, that time when you've handed in your dissertation and you're only preparing for your defense. Working, but not to the extent that you have for as long as you remember. You do, though, have to take care of yourself more than you have before, watching what you eat, sleeping, working on the mental part of swimming, and trying not to freak out. That's the same in both regards - in swimming, you trust your hard work will pay off, just as you do with your dissertation defense. You know what you've done, you can't do any more, and you've got to be confident in what you have. Then the day comes, you perform, you (hopefully) PR in your events and (hopefully) pass your defense.

Through all of this, I learned plenty of time-management and organizational skills. I learned how to work with a wide range of people. I learned, more than anything, that one bad step isn't the end. A bad time or an off practice just meant I had to reevaluate my current approach. A bad result in the lab means I need to revist my notes and rethink my experimental approach. Swimming taught me to be tough, but it also taught me that failure is temporary and can lead to greater successes.
