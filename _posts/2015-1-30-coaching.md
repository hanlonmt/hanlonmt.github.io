I started coaching swimming when I was 16, mostly as a summer gig to make enough money so that I could drive around and hang out with my friends. I continued the job throughout the rest of high school and college to make a little extra money. I mostly kept it because I was already always at the pool, so it was the easiest job for me to have. Throughout college, I coached in the summer, leaving lab for a few hours each day to yell at children. It gave my days some additional structure and allowed me to do something different, *really different*, for a little bit each day. It wasn't until grad school that I realized how beneficial this was to my science and research.

## Teaching

This morning, I was leading a master's workout, trying to get a non-swimmer to improve her kick. To anyone who has swum substantially, the kick is a natural motion, with pointed toes and fluid motion. To a non-swimmer, especially a tight-ankled runner, the kick is an enemy, creating more drag then propulsion. As I went through the motion, highlighting the actions of each muscle group, describing the subtle motions of ankle flexion and extension, I realized that I was teaching. The teaching wasn't that different from what I do in a classroom or in the lab with new students: taking a concept that I'm familiar with and distilling it down to digestible pieces for someone else to pick up and assemble.


I've learned through teaching the form and technique of swimming to children and adults that different phrasing and illustration can make a huge difference in the grasping of a concept. My own freestyle pull was inefficient until I had a coach tell me to think of my hand as an anchor that I swim over. Others do better when you describe it as a ladder or rock climbing. Still, a third group likes to think of it as swimming over a barrel. This is but one small motion, the same as one small concept in a classroom setting. With coaching, as with teaching, my patience has been tested, but I realize that the inability of my swimmers to learn is as much my fault as it is theirs. Unlike teaching, where tests fill the role of evaluation, every stroke serves as an individual assessment. Much like the swimmer who wants to improve, the student who is invested in his or her own education will see the most success. I also have a booming swim coach voice that is *very* useful when trying to get a classroom to pay attention.

## Communication

I've been coaching a Masters program for the past five years, and my swimmers range from college students to retirees. It's a wide-ranging and diverse group, some of whom I also interact with in a professional context. All of them have asked what I do, and I've had to explain my research to a lay audience countless times. I've explained to them my large goals, my individual grant proposals, and the daily struggles I face in the lab. I've gained insight into my problems by talking to others. I've run ideas past the journalists and English faculty on the team for feedback. I've chatted with many about why GMOs aren't bad and what the organic label on your produce actually means. By opening myself up to a wider audience, I've come to realize my place and value in a wider context.

## Confidence

Every day that I coach, I stand in front of a group of people, many of whom are my superiors in the academic realm, and boss them around. I tell them what to do and critique them on it. In such a position, one can not be shy or timid. When the roles are switched and I am swimming, I want to be critiqued; this is the point of being coached. Carrying this over to science, I don't hesitate to offer constructive criticism to anyone who I work with, and I also seek it out on my own projects. I think confidence is something that grad students, especially female grad students, struggle with. Of course, being confident in your science is very different than being confident in life (or swimming), but it is a trait that some have in all aspects of life.

I had no plans to continue coaching throughout grad school, but it's been very beneficial. Injuries have kept me from swimming as much as I would like, but keeping the pool (and the friends who I have there) in my life has made my experience much better. Having a [side gig is great](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/gradhacker/start-side-gig), but make sure it's something you really enjoy.
