I've been back home in PA for just about a week now. After a (somewhat expected) delay-filled return trip, I made it back to the tropical winter weather (SO MUCH DAYLIGHT) of the northeast. Everyone has been asking me how I liked Sweden, and I think I've finally put together a coherent response, which I'll articulate here. I'll hopefully also get back into posting regularly, as my jet-lag and travel-sickness begin to subside.

## The good
There are certainly things that I'll miss about Sweden, relating to both work and life. I expected this list to be much longer, but here's what is on it:

<img style="float: right" src="/images/bikepath.jpg" hspace="20">

- **Bike Paths.** In Ume&aring;, I could bike anywhere on a separated and maintained bike path (there are [180km of bike paths](http://www.umu.se/english/umea/get-around) in the city). Granted, there are some cities in the US with good bike infrastructure, and my town is [incredibly bike-friendly](http://www.statecollegepa.us/index.aspx?NID=439) by American standards, but it has nothing on Ume&aring;. Being an all-weather biker, I really appreciate the separated paths, especially in the winter.  

- **Things work.** Both at work and in the general society, things seem to work. If something is broken, someone fixes it. I suppose this is how things *should* work in general, but that doesn't seem to happen here. Things sit broken for long periods of time because no one has the time to fix them. If it relates to graduate students, then I think it's safe to assume that it will never be fixed. In Sweden, maintenance and upkeep (along with cleaning!) kept things running. 

- **Graduate students are treated like people.** They get paid! They have parental leave! They're given computers and help! If you aren't in graduate school yet, consider going to graduate school in Sweden, seriously. It's like graduate school heaven. I've had it pretty good, with travel and benefits, but I look like a measly beggar compared to the Swedish grad students. 

## The things that could go either way
- **Road salt.** As a life-long inhabitant of the northeastern US, I know the damage road salt does to your cars, shoes, and anything else that it comes into contact with. I also know that without it, I would fall (I did that this morning, just to make things clear). In Sweden, salt is nearly non-existent. The roads were generally clear, but the walk-ways and bike paths were sheets of ice when we would get freeze-thaw cycles, which was just about every day. They did put down gravel, but the gravel would then get iced over. I slipped, a lot. I wrecked by bike a few times. It was not fun.

- **Everyone works regular hours.** I like to think that this is a good thing. You're only expected to be at work during these hours. That being said, my brain almost always lulls around 2 or 3 PM, at which point my productivity drops. Here, I use this time to exercise, do something non-work related (like write a blog post), or just go for a walk. I have the flexibility to make my own hours, and I take advantage of that. Because everyone works the same hours, leaving is weird. That being said, very few people work on the weekends, as they're supposed to be a time of rest and relaxation. That makes this one a toss-up.


## The bad
- **Uniformity.** Everything is the same. Everyone wears black. Everyone does the same thing on certain days of the week. I'm sure there are exceptions, but there was much more uniformity than I'm used to, and not fitting in is much more of a 'bad thing' than it is here. Maybe it's because there is less of an American identity than there is a Swedish identity. I didn't expect this going in, and I think we (read: liberal Americans) have romanticized Sweden a bit, and there are great things, but everyone conforming to the same set of ideals is quite a snooze.

- **Lack of spontaneity.** In my experience, everything was planned. People tended to function on a schedule and followed the same schedule nearly every day. Even going to a restaurant often required booking (as opposed to just showing up). There was never talk of just going to grab a beer after work or at any other time. Being one who isn't a fan of scheduling, this was one of my least favorite things, but I'm sure some people like it. This extended to social situations, where just going and introducing yourself to someone isn't something that Swedish people do (nor do they do small talk). I think this, combined with the uniformity, led me to believe that things were boring. That may just because I, as an American, require constant stimulation. 

- **Dark.** Does this one require an explanation? Darkness sucks. Here is a picture of a 2PM sunset:

## Now?
I'm happy to be home, for lots of reasons, including not living out of a suitcase (the same couple of sweaters gets boring), having all of my kitchen supplies and gadgets, and having actual spicy food. I also missed my bicycle a lot, but I just wish I could have those bike paths back.
