I wrote a whole post about 'omics,' and then my computer crashed and I lost it. So, now I'm going to write about something different: the prospective student.

## The campus interview

Every program/department/university does their graduate student selection process slightly differently, but ours follows the apply, review, campus interview, acceptance, financial offer, negotiation model. Our student do not enter under the tutelage of a single faculty adviser, but do rotations in their first year before deciding on a lab to call home. As the student program representative/token outgoing grad student, I always help out, showing people around campus, answering questions, and eating free food. Every group of students is different, but there are always certain personalities that stand out. They include, but are not limited to the following:

- The silent lost one. Sometimes, we lose track of our prospective students. The ones we lose are always quiet, hide in the shadows, don't seem enthusiastic about anything, and are usually male. I have nothing to really say about this other than that they're always there (except when we lose them - we always find them). I've also referred to these people as ghosts, and generally can't remember them more than a week after their interview.
- The nervous Nancy or Nathan. I couldn't think of another guy's name that starts with 'N' so it became Nathan. These prospective students are always on edge, always trying to impress, and treat every little action as an interview. As current students, we don't have much say into who gets into the program, but we can notify the admissions committee of red flags. In my five years of helping with this, we've only flagged three students, one of whom was a Nervous Nancy. The others were all too into themselves.
- The one who is too into him/herself. This may be my least favorite, the interviewing student who one-ups everything we say. Listen, we're a bunch of dismal graduate students, but we are all graduate students who are already in the program that you're trying to get into. You don't have to be better than us, but it does help to fit in. If you don't, we will let the admissions committee know. 
- The meh. It's not horrible to be 'meh.' If you have strong academics, and you're meh, then you'll get in (usually). There's nothing wrong with it, but ... you know.
- The 'we like that person.' Everyone's favorite. We want the people we like to come to grad school here because we like them. Sometimes, we like people and then we find out that the admissions committee didn't, and that's always a bummer. This is the group you should strive to be in.

## Conclusions

Reading over that, it feels like a trip to a high school cafeteria full of groups of people. Just keep in mind that we're all kind of nerdy losers when you think about it - we're graduate students in plant biology. Never has that how society describes a cool kid. It's all relative.
