While spending some quality time with R today, I heard a sound that brought back wonderful memories: an American voice. I was, though, not in my office (it's a holiday in Sweden), but in the loft area of my gym lobby (it's not *that* weird, and the picture is here to prove it). It's an odd place to work, I'll give you that, but the lighting is nice, the temperature warm (much warmer than my office), and the wifi reliable. After all of my code failed and my report of lackluster results was sent off to my PI, I played my American card, approached the speaker, and said "it's odd to hear another American accent around here." At this point, another voice says "I was thinking the same thing," and we proceeded to have a discussion about everything. Immediate friends.

One of the girls was sitting with her co-worker, who said "Wow, a Swede would never do what you did." The art of the cold introduction is not one favored by our northern friends, and is something that I miss terribly. While talking with my new friends, we lamented over the lack of American convenience and general difference between here and home. The Swede then said to his friend "so everything you've told me is true!" Americans, unite.

So other than Trader Joes, Wegmans, Amazon (Prime shipping!), and bourbon, I mostly miss Americans. My new friends agreed. We don't miss the immaturity and closed-mindedness of many Americans, but we miss the outgoing personalities. We don't miss constantly being suspicious of other's intentions, but we do miss people going out of their way to help you.  We don't miss overwhelming noise, but we do miss constant activity.

Sweden, I've loved my time here, but America, you have my heart. I'll have a longer post to wrap up all of my Swedish adventures when I head home in two weeks. There are some things I've really enjoyed about the society and the people, and there are definitely things that we could adopt in America, but *lagom* isn't one of them.

At the end of the ten minute conversation with my new friends, I was invited to fika. There will be loud conversation without awkward silence.
