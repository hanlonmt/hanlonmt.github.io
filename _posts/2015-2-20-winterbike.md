When I left my house this morning, the temperature was -7&#176;F(-22&#176;C) with a windchill that made it much colder. I bundled up, got on my bicycle, and made it to campus. Then I went swimming.
<br><br>
Crazy? Maybe. But I'll defend my cold-weather cycling any day.

## The gear

Cold weather cycling can be uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I make it do-able through smart layering, bright lights, and a bit of grit. On a day like today, I'm wearing the following:

- Two pairs of wool socks. Today, both happen to be Smartwool. One pair of thin socks, one pair of thicker hikers. If I'm going to be outside for an especially long time, I throw on some extra-thick ski socks. 
- Boots. Today, I'm sporting my [Teva de la Vina's](http://www.teva.com/women-boots/de-la-vina/1003011.html) because I can fit two pairs of socks inside, they're waterproof, and I can wear them all day without looking like I just finished trekking over a mountain. [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-womens-winter-boots/) just released their women's winter boot guide, so you could probably forgo the two pairs of socks if you sported some of these. If you're cycling intensely, then you can get yourself some all-weather shoe covers. But, to make the biking commute-to-work transition easier, I go with this.
- Long underwear. During the winter, I'm almost always sporting a pair of merino wool long underwear. Some people may argue for synthetics. We all have preferences, but I'll argue wool to the death. I usually stop by TJMaxx and pick up a few pairs when the winter season ends. If you're going to splurge, go with Icebreaker. Also: wool, magically, doesn't stink.
- Jeans, or whatever. This doesn't really matter. I have magical wool next to my body.
- A long parka. Some people question this decision, asking if it gets 'tangled' in my bike. I don't really know how that would happen. My jacket ends just above my knees. I'm not like actively putting it into my bike chain. This confuses me, but I roll with it. Biking is a functional activity, and long jackets are functional. Case closed.
- Shirts and sweaters (probably wool). With a long jacket, this isn't too crucial, so I just dress to be comfortable for the day.
- Gloves. Options abound here. I usually wear a pair of (you guessed it!) wool glove liners that I can sport throughout the day. The pair I have now is from Hestra, and I bought them in Sweden, so they're totally super legitimate winter gear. The outer gloves are where I mix it up. I have mittens, lobster gloves, and regular gloves. Today, I went with a pair of Marmot gloves, which are pretty warm and serve me well. I think appropriate glove weight is a game that everyone has to figure out on their own.
- Neck gaiter. Mine is a bright synthetic material that I got on closeout at Ross Dress for Less. It does a great job. Someday, I'll upgrade to wool. This is a critical part of the garb though and should not be skipped. A neck gaiter or balaclava is much better at sealing you off from the cold than a scarf (I'm speaking from experience). 
- Hat. I sport a [Pearl Izumi Barrier Cycling Cap](http://www.amazon.com/Pearl-Izumi-Mens-Barrier-Cycling/dp/B00943C066). It's warm and fits under my helmet. I've worn other combos (ear warmers and beanies) in the past, but like this one. The visor is great when snow is falling and I want to keep it out of my eyes.
- Helmet. Duh.
- Ski Goggles. These are for the coldest of the cold days. On other days (anything above 0), I just let the icicles form on my eyelashes. The ski goggles really help, though, in the extreme cold and also protect all of my exposed skin.

That's it! Then I just look like a monster biking through the streets. Everyone looks at me weird, but this is probably due to my garb, the fact that I have a plastic squeaky dinosaur on my handlebars, and because I have plenty of bright lights on my bike. Safety first, kids.

## But why?

Why go through all of this trouble when you could drive, walk, or ride the bus? Don't fear, dear reader, I have answers.
<br><br>
My house is 1.7 miles from my office. If I were to drive, I would drive 2+ miles to park in a lot that is 0.8 miles from my office. I would then have to either ride a shuttle or walk to my office. This doesn't make sense. If I walked, which I have done, I would spend 40+ minutes in the cold, which is a long time to me. The bus? This is the hardest one for me to refute. I'm an advocate for public transit, and this is probably my second best option, but at the times I go to and from campus, the bus frequency isn't that high. I also like making my own schedule. This all just means that I am stubborn. So I bike.
<br><br>
I also bike because I love it. Sure, I curse the hill that I have to ride up, especially if it's the morning after a hard workout and my legs are already aching. Nothing beats riding down that hill on the way home, though, leaving the stress of the day behind me, and remembering what it feels like to be a kid and zoom around on two wheels. When I move, I've made a bicycle my first purchase if I haven't brought one with me. It allows for exploration and discovery in a way that no other form of transportation does. I remember when I got my first bike, on Christmas when I was five, and I immediately went to ride it outside, in the snow, in my pajamas. I wrecked into a bush at the end of our driveway and had cuts all over. I rode that bike nearly every day, wrecking it, getting it stuck in the mud, popping the chain off while jumping over logs in the woods. It was from some sort of 1990-Wal-Mart store (Ames, probably), was bright pink and I decked it out with noise-makers on the spokes. I also took it apart to figure out how it worked. Some things never change.

Every child needs to be introduced to cycling, and that we should work to fight the class divides that shape both biking and cycling. The utility of the bike and the sport of the bike are separated, though some data suggests that the two are more closely tied than we think. There are a few interesting articles on this, including [this from People for Bikes](http://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/rich-poor-both-know-good-biking-when-they-see-it-new-data-shows) showing that poorer people commute by bike more, but in states where the rich commute by bike, so do the poor. This article is further explained and expanded upon [here](http://bloomingrock.com/2014/08/12/biking-is-not-a-race-issue-or-is-it/):

> My appeal to the bike advocacy community is to expand its efforts beyond potential cyclists who may bicycle by choice and to the huge number of people who bicycle by necessity but aspire not to for cultural reasons despite the fact that it is much cheaper to own and ride a bicycle than to own and drive a car.

That sentiment is echoed in [this piece from Citylab from July 2014](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/07/how-low-income-commuters-view-cycling/374390/). The key to improving bike commuting not bashing the car, but showing the perks of cycling. My generation doesn't seem to [want to own cars](http://www.npr.org/2013/08/21/209579037/why-millennials-are-ditching-cars-and-redefining-ownership), so maybe we're on to something.

One of my favorite articles on the internet is this piece in the Ms. Magazine blog - [Wheels of Change: The Bicycle and Women's Rights](http://msmagazine.com/blog/2014/05/07/wheels-of-change-the-bicycle-and-womens-rights/). If you haven't read it, please do. It ends with this: 

>The bike granted women freedom of movement. And not just literally. It became a symbol, an emblem for emancipation and selfhood. And there would be no undoing. The bicycling craze eventually died down after the turn of the century, and soon automobiles were the next great craze. But the awakening the wheel spurred in women inspired the strength and perseverance of the New Woman and continued to influence women for generations to come.

So, go, get out, and ride bikes!
