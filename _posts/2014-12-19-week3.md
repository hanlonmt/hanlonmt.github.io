Things I've liked this week!

### [NYT: Why U.S. women are leaving jobs behind](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/upshot/us-employment-women-not-working.html?_r=0)
An interesting take on women working and how the system in the US doesn't make baby-having and career-advancing compatible. 

### [Are Velodromes the Future of City Sports, or the Past?](http://www.citylab.com/politics/2014/12/are-velodromes-the-future-of-sports-for-cities/383849/)
I love bicycles, but drivers hate cyclists. Why not put them in a velodrome? This aritcle on CityLab poses interesting questions, juxtaposing developments in bike-loving, velodrome-hating Minneapolis and Philadelphia, not known for bike culture (or really culture, I'm holding onto my Western PA roots here). Worth a read and some consideration.

### [NPR Songs We Love 2014](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/12/the-secret-history-of-cars-begins-with-bicycles/383254/)
I love NPR. NPR loves songs. Ergo, I love songs, too. This website app puts the most-loved NPR songs straight into your ears. Listen. Enjoy. 

### [Parody: The Last Episode of Serial](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/6ab2d45a77/the-last-episode-of-serial)
Like many, I've been following Serial from week to week, and the last episode went live this week. This parody on Funny or Die captures it perfectly, especially the text to Jay part. If you don't listen to Serial, you won't get it, you should also probably start listening, like, now.

### [Puppies.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ie_XgIM06M)
Doug the Pug is my Christmas spirit animal.
