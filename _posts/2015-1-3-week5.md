Things I've liked this week!

#####[Start Up: The Podcast](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/)
I started listening to this podcast when it began, but took a break. This week, I binged on the episodes and got *really* into it. The podcast tells the story of a Start Up led by Alex Blumberg (formerly of This American Life and Planet Money) that aims to make high quality podcasts. If you listen to podcasts, check this out. If you don't, start (maybe start with Serial, though).

##### [A big discussion about whether you should wear a bike helmet gets it wrong from the first line.](http://www.treehugger.com/bikes/big-discussion-about-whether-you-should-wear-bike-helmet-gets-it-wrong-first-line.html)
At home, I always wear my helmet. I've been in a few accidents, and I've had a few concussions, though these aren't related. I also ride on the roads and am generally forced to ride defensively. I also think that drivers generally think poorly of bikers, but think a bit more highly of those who wear helmets (and abhor those without lights and/or who wear headphones. I hate those people.).  This is an interesting discussion on the topic about helmets, biking, and transportation in general.

##### [Not Just A Man's Drink: Ladies Lead The Whiskey Renaissance](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/12/29/371652827/ladies-lead-whiskey-renaissance-as-distillers-and-new-tipplers?utm_campaign=storyshare&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social)
I love bourbon. This article from NPR speaks to me, but brings up some interesting points. Some women think others will look at them funny if they are drinking whiskey. My friends often call me an old man (hey, Old Fashioneds are good!), and I embrace it. Bring on the booze! Related: I can't wait to get back to America. Sweden's bourbon market is dismal.

Just go and look. It's like this, but 37 times better.
