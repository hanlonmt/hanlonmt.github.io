I was curious to see what the trends in plant biology funding are/were and what this can tell us about what we work on (or what funding agencies want us to work on). I pulled this data from the NSF databases by searching for all grants with plant(s) or crop(s) in the title or abstract. I figured this would get most plant biology research and not much else. I only collected standard grants and nothing related to funding only workshops, meetings, or symposia.  This left me with 1,256 grants since 2010 in five different divisions (DBI - 164, DEB - 580, EF - 86, IOS - 192, and MCB - 57).

This is a preliminary exploration and I'll go into more detail later. In this post, I'll go over some geographical data and keyword data.  No PI has more than five awards, and four are the lead on five awards. I will look more into this (including co-PI data) in a future post.

## Geography

California leads the way with the most awards, with UC Davis (35) and UC Berkeley (32) having the first and third most awards, respectively (Duke in second with 34). Here's a map I made to visualize this. I used modified code from [Bertplot](http://www.bertplot.com/visualization/?p=524#comments) to produce it.

I then wanted to see how much these states got, in dollars. Unfortunately, the data from the NSF is 'funding given to date' which can be a bit funky because a new grant hasn't gotten all of it's money. Because this is just me playing around with data and isn't really anything of importance, I went with it. From these graphs, you can see that California has the most money, but grant size is smaller.

## About what?
The geography data is just data for data's sake. The real meat is here in the exploration of what the money is funding. Looking at the words used most commonly (removing conjuctions and other filler words), we get these data for the titles (left) and abstracts (right). Click to make larger.

</figure>
<br><br>
Plant tops the list in both (surprise), with evolution also scoring high in titles. Interestingly, many of the common terms in abstracts don't relate to the science, but are more related to administration (university, student, graduate).
