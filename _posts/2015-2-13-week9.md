### Happy Galentine's Day!
The most important holiday of the year!

### [Northern Lights: Do the Scandinavians have it all figured out (The New Yorker)](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/16/northern-lights-4)
This article goes along with what I've said about my time in Sweden before: not too exciting.

###[Not everything should be crowdfunded (PS Mag)](http://www.psmag.com/nature-and-technology/your-startup-is-stupid)
In an ethics class that I'm taking, we discussed crowdfunding and it's use to fund sexy (or psychology) research. Projects about root growth behavior, *oddly*, don't top the list of crowdfunding success stories. Here, Susie Cagle calls out the crowdfunded snake oil salsemen and hopes for something different in the future.

###[Ruth Bader Ginsberg talks feminism](http://www.vox.com/2015/2/7/7994167/bader-ginsburg-feminism-video)

Mostly this:

>"If I could have any talent in the world, any talent that god could give me, I would be a great diva."

And the fact that she said she wasn't ["100% sober" during the State of the Union](http://www.vox.com/2015/2/13/8033211/ruth-bader-ginsburg-asleep).
