## M. Hanlon: Student, researcher, scientist

Though my given name is Meredith, most of you probably know me as Molly. I'm a Ph.D student in the [Plant Biology Program](http://www.huck.psu.edu/content/graduate-programs/plant-biology) at Penn State University, and a member of the [Penn State Roots Lab](http://roots.psu.edu). 

I'm working to translate knowledge that we've gained by studying everyone's favorite lab weed, *Arabidopsis thaliana*, to important food crops, including rice and maize. More information about my current and past projects can be found on the [research page](http://mollyhanlon.com/research). Other things you can find on this website include a copy of my [CV](http://mollyhanlon.com/cv), information on my [teaching philosophy and experiences](http://mollyhanlon.com/teaching), tips and tricks that I use while struggling to master [R](http://mollyhanlon.com/Rarchive?), and a [blog](http://mollyhanlon.com/blog).

The blog has it's own name: "the m<sup>th</sup> root", which combines my initials (MTH) and roots - one of my favorite things. I've also gathered a collection of some of my other favorite things, ranging from producitivity tools, to software, to podcasts, and other things that power me through the day. Check it out [here](http://mollyhanlon.com/misc)!  On the blog, most of my posts relate to science (mostly plants!), education, and academia, but there will be a good bit of other stuff hidden in here as well. Though my living is science, my life is much more than science.


## Molly: the non-science version

Outside of science, I spend a good bit of time swimming and playing soccer. I swam competitively through college, and now spend my time with our local US Masters Swim team. I ride my bicycle pretty much everywhere (the picture at the top of this page was taken in the middle of a long ride), and also enjoy exploring the hills and forests of central Pennsylvania on foot. 

If you want to get in touch with me, send me an email: <me@mollyhanlon.com>, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/meredith-molly-hanlon/11/714/a25) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meredith_Hanlon), or see what I'm up to on [twitter](http://twitter.com/molslarity).
