Sometimes, I'm not on the internet AND not working. In real life, I like the following things.
- Bicycles. I have too many. I want more
- External battery chargers. Back in the day, these were rare. Now quite common, I don't go on an extended trip or to a long meeting without one.
- Minaal bag. I wanted a good backpack to travel. After searching around, I landed on the Minaal bag. I love it.
- Soft floor pads. At home, I have a standing desk. This pad saves my feet and makes me happy.
- Grid-it organizers. I like to pretend to be organized. These help
- Packing cubes. These also help. I hate messy suitcases.
- Rain Pants. In the US, everyone things that my waterproof rain pants are dorky (except my Dad, who also has them). In Sweden, they're the status quo. Anywhere in the world, I like them (or I just dislike wet pants).
- Notebooks of graph paper. My first lab supervisor never used lined paper, but rather, gridded paper. I adopted that habit and buy all of my notebooks with grids (also the squares are fun to color in during a boring seminar).
- Comfortable shoes. I have lots of opinions on shoes. I recently switched to Saucony Glide 7's for running, ending my long relationship with Aasics. Now, I've begun to question all of my shoe allegiances. I'll come back to this.
- Wool. Wool socks, wool sweaters, wool caps. You name it, I like it (unless it's itchy, then I don't like it).
